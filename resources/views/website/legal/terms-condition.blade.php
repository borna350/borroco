            <p>The Holder undertakes to describe and to present the Products sold on the Application to the best of his
                abilities. Nonetheless, some mistakes, inaccuracies or minor differences between the Application and the
                actual Product may occur.</p>
            <p>In addition, any picture of the Products which may be found on the Application does not constitute a
                contractual element, but merely provides a visual representation of the Product.</p>
            <p>The User expressly confers to the Holder the right to accept, wholly or in part, the order (for example
                if not all of the ordered Products are available). In this case, the contract will only be completed
                with regard to the Products which are actually sold.</p>
            <p>The Holder has the right to refuse an order:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>when the Product is not available;</li>
                <li>when it is denied the authorization to charge the User with the cost of the Product;</li>
                <li>when, at the time of purchase, the price displayed is obviously incorrect and is recognisable as In
                    such case, the User will be contacted by the Customer Service to be informed of the situation and
                    will be refunded the amount charged.

            </ol>

            <h1>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prices and payments</h1>
            <p>The Holder retains the right to change, at any time, the price of the Products and any related shipping
                charges. It shall be understood that any changes will not apply to contracts already concluded before
                such modifications.</p>
            <p>The selling prices of the Products include VAT, if due; any other tax and/or shipping cost borne by the
                User will be displayed prior to order confirmation.</p>
            <p>The User undertakes to pay the price of the purchased Products in the times and methods indicated in the
                Application.</p>
            <p>Any refund to the User will be promptly credited through one of the payment methods proposed by the
                Holder and chosen by the User and, in case of exercise of the right of withdrawal, at the latest within
                30 days from the date on which the Holder received notice of the withdrawal.</p>
            <p>The Application makes use of payment services provided by third-parties and it does not receive nor
                process any payment details provided by Users (credit card number, name of holder, pin, etc.).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the event that the above third-party payment services refuse to authorise a payment, the Holder will
                not be able to provide the Products and may not be held responsible for any delay or failure in their
                delivery.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h1>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billing</h1>
            <p>Users who may wish to receive the invoice will be required to provide their billing information. The
                invoice will be issued according to the information provided by the User, which the latter declares and
                ensures to be truthful, thus conferring the Holder with the widest indemnity on the matter.</p>

                prejudice to the right to withdrawal.</p>

                intends to confirm the order or less.</p>

                majeure events, such as accidents, explosions, fires, strikes and / or lockouts, earthquakes, floods and
                any other event that may prevent, in whole or in part, the performance of the contract within due
                time.</p>

                Article 128, paragraph 2 of the Consumer Code, sold through the Application are covered by the legal
                guarantee of conformity provided for in Articles 128-135 of the Consumer Code.</p>
            <p>The legal guarantee of conformity is limited to consumers. Therefore, it applies only to Users who have
                purchased on the Application for purposes unrelated to their possible entrepreneurial, commercial,
                crafts or professional activity .</p>
            <p>To those who purchased on the Application and who are not consumers, the following warranties shall
                apply: the warranties for defects of the Product sold, the warranty for defects concerning the qualities
                promised and essential, and the other guarantees provided by the “Codice Civile” (“Civil Code”), as well
                as the relative terms, disqualifications and restrictions (Article 1490 et seq. Codice Civile).</p>
            <p>The lack of conformity noticed within 24 months from the date of purchase of the Product must be reported
                within 2 months after the date of discovery of the defect.</p>
            <p>Unless proven otherwise, it is assumed that any defect noticed within six months of the delivery of the
                Product already existed on the date of delivery, unless this assumption is incompatible with the nature
                of the product or the nature of the defect. After the six months period, the user shall prove that the
                damage has not been caused by an erroneous use or misuse of the Product.</p>
            <p>In accordance to Article 130 of the Consumer Code, in the event of a lack of conformity of the Product,
                the User has the right to have the Product restored to conformity, without any charge. For such purpose,
                the User can normally choose between the repair of the Product or its replacement. Such right of choice
                cannot be exercised in case the requested remedy is materially impossible or excessively onerous. In
                addition, the User has the right to a reasonable price reduction, or termination of the contract,
                provided</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>that one of the following occurs: i) the repair and replacement are impossible or excessively expensive;
                ii) the Holder has failed to repair or replace the Product within a reasonable period of time; iii) the
                replacement or repair have caused significant inconveniences to the consumer.</p>
            <p>Whenever the User intends to make use of the remedies provided by the legal guarantee provided with the
                Products, the User shall contact the Holder at the email address <a
                        href="mailto:support@barrocoitalia.com">support@barrocoitalia.com</a>. The Holder shall promptly
                reply to the communication of the alleged lack of conformity and shall indicate to the User the specific
                procedure to be followed, taking into account the category of goods relating to the Product, and / or
                the alleged defect.</p>
